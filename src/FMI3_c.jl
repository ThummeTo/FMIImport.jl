Source: FMISpec3.0, Version D5ef1c1: 4.2.2. State: Intermediate Update Mode

When a Co-Simulation FMU provides values for its output variables at intermediate points between two consecutive communication points, and is able to receive new values for input variables at these intermediate points, the Intermediate Update Callback function is called. This is typically required when the FMU uses a numerical solver to integrate the FMU's internal state between communication points in fmi3DoStep. 
The callback function switches the FMU from Step Mode (see 4.2.1.) in the Intermediate Update Mode (see 4.2.2.) and returns to Step Mode afterwards. The parameters of this function are:

instanceEnvironment - is the instance name of the model that calls this function. 

intermediateUpdateTime - is the internal value of the independent variable [typically simulation time] of the FMU at which the callback has been called for intermediate and final steps. If an event happens or an output Clock ticks, intermediateUpdateTime is the time of event or output Clock tick. In Co-Simulation, intermediateUpdateTime is restricted by the arguments to fmi3DoStep as follows:
currentCommunicationPoint ≤ intermediateUpdateTime ≤ (currentCommunicationPoint + communicationStepSize).
The FMU must not call the callback function fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate with an intermediateUpdateTime that is smaller than the intermediateUpdateTime given in a previous call of fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate with intermediateStepFinished == fmi3True.

If intermediateVariableSetRequested == fmi3True, the co-simulation algorithm may provide intermediate values for continuous input variables with intermediateUpdate = true by calling fmi3Set{VariableType}. The set of variables for which the co-simulation algorithm will provide intermediate values is declared through the requiredIntermediateVariables argument to fmi3InstantiateXXX. If a co-simulation algorithm does not provide a new value for any of the variables contained in the set it registered, the last value set remains.

If intermediateVariableGetAllowed == fmi3True, the co-simulation algorithm may collect intermediate output variables by calling fmi3Get{VariableType} for variables with intermediateUpdate = true. The set of variables for which the co-simulation algorithm can get values is supplied through the requiredIntermediateVariables argument to fmi3InstantiateXXX.

If intermediateStepFinished == fmi3False, the intermediate outputs of the FMU that the co-simulation algorithm inquires with fmi3Get{VariableType} resulting from tentative internal solver states and may still change for the same intermediateUpdateTime [e.g., if the solver deems the tentative state to cause a too high approximation error, it may go back in time and try to re-estimate the state using smaller internal time steps].
If intermediateStepFinished == fmi3True, intermediate outputs inquired by the co-simulation algorithm with fmi3Get{VariableType} correspond to accepted internal solver step.

When canReturnEarly == fmi3True the FMU signals to the co-simulation algorithm its ability to return early from the current fmi3DoStep.

earlyReturnRequested - If and only if canReturnEarly == fmi3True, the co-simulation algorithm may request the FMU to return early from fmi3DoStep by setting earlyReturnRequested == fmi3True.

earlyReturnTime is used to signal the FMU at which time to return early from the current fmi3DoStep, if the return value of earlyReturnRequested == fmi3True. If the earlyReturnTime is greater than the last signaled intermediateUpdateTime, the FMU may integrate up to the time instant earlyReturnTime.

If the ModelDescription has the "providesIntermediateUpdate" flag, the Intermediate update callback function is called. That flag is ignored in ModelExchange and ScheduledExecution.

Source: FMISpec3.0, Version D5ef1c1: 2.2.10. Dependencies of Variables

The actual dependencies (of type dependenciesKind) can be retrieved by calling the function fmi3GetVariableDependencies:

dependent - specifies the valueReference of the variable for which the dependencies should be returned.

nDependencies - specifies the number of dependencies that the calling environment allocated space for in the result buffers, and should correspond to value obtained by calling fmi3GetNumberOfVariableDependencies.

elementIndicesOfDependent - must point to a buffer of size_t values of size nDependencies allocated by the calling environment. 
It is filled in by this function with the element index of the dependent variable that dependency information is provided for. The element indices start with 1. Using the element index 0 means all elements of the variable. (Note: If an array has more than one dimension the indices are serialized in the same order as defined for values in Section 2.2.6.1.)

independents -  must point to a buffer of fmi3ValueReference values of size nDependencies allocated by the calling environment. 
It is filled in by this function with the value reference of the independent variable that this dependency entry is dependent upon.

elementIndicesIndependents - must point to a buffer of size_t values of size nDependencies allocated by the calling environment. 
It is filled in by this function with the element index of the independent variable that this dependency entry is dependent upon. The element indices start with 1. Using the element index 0 means all elements of the variable. (Note: If an array has more than one dimension the indices are serialized in the same order as defined for values in Section 2.2.6.1.)

dependencyKinds - must point to a buffer of dependenciesKind values of size nDependencies allocated by the calling environment. 
It is filled in by this function with the enumeration value describing the dependency of this dependency entry.
For more information about dependenciesKinds, call ?fmi3DependencyKind

If this function is called before the fmi3ExitInitializationMode call, it returns the initial dependencies. If this function is called after the fmi3ExitInitializationMode call, it returns the runtime dependencies. 
The retrieved dependency information of one variable becomes invalid as soon as a structural parameter linked to the variable or to any of its depending variables are set. As a consequence, if you change structural parameters affecting B or A, the dependency of B becomes invalid. The dependency information must change only if structural parameters are changed.

Source: FMISpec3.0, Version D5ef1c1: 2.2.12. Getting Derivatives of Continuous Outputs

Retrieves the n-th derivative of output values.

valueReferences - is a vector of value references that define the variables whose derivatives shall be retrieved. If multiple derivatives of a variable shall be retrieved, list the value reference multiple times.

nValueReferences - is the dimension of the arguments valueReferences and orders.

orders - contains the orders of the respective derivative (1 means the first derivative, 2 means the second derivative, …, 0 is not allowed). 
If multiple derivatives of a variable shall be retrieved, provide a list of them in the orders array, corresponding to a multiply occurring value reference in the valueReferences array.
The highest order of derivatives retrievable can be determined by the 'maxOutputDerivativeOrder' tag in the ModelDescription.

values - is a vector with the values of the derivatives. The order of the values elements is derived from a twofold serialization: the outer level corresponds to the combination of a value reference (e.g., valueReferences[k]) and order (e.g., orders[k]), and the inner level to the serialization of variables as defined in Section 2.2.6.1. The inner level does not exist for scalar variables.

nValues - is the size of the argument values. nValues only equals nValueReferences if all corresponding output variables are scalar variables.
