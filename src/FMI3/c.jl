Function that is called in the FMU, usually if an fmi3XXX function, does not behave as desired. If “logger” is called with “status = fmi3OK”, then the message is a pure information message. 

# Arguments
- `_instanceEnvironment::Ptr{FMU3InstanceEnvironment}`: is the instance name of the model that calls this function. 
- `_status::Cuint`: status of the message
- `_category::Ptr{Cchar}`: is the category of the message. The meaning of “category” is defined by the modeling environment that generated the FMU. Depending on this modeling environment, none, some or all allowed values of “category” for this FMU are defined in the modelDescription.xml file via element “<fmiModelDescription><LogCategories>”, see section 2.4.5. Only messages are provided by function logger that have a category according to a call to `fmi3SetDebugLogging` (see below). 
- `_message::Ptr{Cchar}`: is provided in the same way and with the same format control as in function “printf” from the C standard library. [Typically, this function prints the message and stores it optionally in a log file.]

    fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate(instanceEnvironment::Ptr{Cvoid},

        canReturnEarly::fmi3Boolean,
        earlyReturnRequested::Ptr{fmi3Boolean},
        earlyReturnTime::Ptr{fmi3Float64})

When a Co-Simulation FMU provides values for its output variables at intermediate points between two consecutive communication points, and is able to receive new values for input variables at these intermediate points, the Intermediate Update Callback function is called. This is typically required when the FMU uses a numerical solver to integrate the FMU's internal state between communication points in `fmi3DoStep`. 
The callback function switches the FMU from Step Mode (see 4.2.1.) in the Intermediate Update Mode (see 4.2.2.) and returns to Step Mode afterwards.
If the ModelDescription has the "providesIntermediateUpdate" flag, the Intermediate update callback function is called. That flag is ignored in ModelExchange and ScheduledExecution.

# Arguments
- `instanceEnvironment::Ptr{FMU3InstanceEnvironment}`: is the instance name of the model that calls this function. 
- `intermediateUpdateTime::fmi3Float64`: is the internal value of the independent variable [typically simulation time] of the FMU at which the callback has been called for intermediate and final steps. If an event happens or an output Clock ticks, intermediateUpdateTime is the time of event or output Clock tick. In Co-Simulation, intermediateUpdateTime is restricted by the arguments to fmi3DoStep as follows:
    currentCommunicationPoint ≤ intermediateUpdateTime ≤ (currentCommunicationPoint + communicationStepSize).
    The FMU must not call the callback function fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate with an intermediateUpdateTime that is smaller than the intermediateUpdateTime given in a previous call of fmi3CallbackIntermediateUpdate with intermediateStepFinished == fmi3True.
- `intermediateVariableSetRequested::fmi3Boolean`: If `intermediateVariableSetRequested == fmi3True`, the co-simulation algorithm may provide intermediate values for continuous input variables with `intermediateUpdate = true` by calling fmi3Set{VariableType}. The set of variables for which the co-simulation algorithm will provide intermediate values is declared through the requiredIntermediateVariables argument to `fmi3InstantiateXXX`. If a co-simulation algorithm does not provide a new value for any of the variables contained in the set it registered, the last value set remains.
- `intermediateVariableGetAllowed::fmi3Boolean`: If `intermediateVariableGetAllowed == fmi3True`, the co-simulation algorithm may collect intermediate output variables by calling fmi3Get{VariableType} for variables with `intermediateUpdate = true`. The set of variables for which the co-simulation algorithm can get values is supplied through the requiredIntermediateVariables argument to `fmi3InstantiateXXX`.
- `intermediateStepFinished::fmi3Boolean`: If `intermediateStepFinished == fmi3False`, the intermediate outputs of the FMU that the co-simulation algorithm inquires with fmi3Get{VariableType} resulting from tentative internal solver states and may still change for the same intermediateUpdateTime [e.g., if the solver deems the tentative state to cause a too high approximation error, it may go back in time and try to re-estimate the state using smaller internal time steps].
                              If `intermediateStepFinished == fmi3True`, intermediate outputs inquired by the co-simulation algorithm with fmi3Get{VariableType} correspond to accepted internal solver step.
- `canReturnEarly::fmi3Boolean`: When `canReturnEarly == fmi3True` the FMU signals to the co-simulation algorithm its ability to return early from the current `fmi3DoStep`.
- `earlyReturnRequested::Ptr{fmi3Boolean}`: If and only if `canReturnEarly == fmi3True`, the co-simulation algorithm may request the FMU to return early from `fmi3DoStep` by setting `earlyReturnRequested == fmi3True`.
- `earlyReturnTime::Ptr{fmi3Float64}`: is used to signal the FMU at which time to return early from the current `fmi3DoStep`, if the return value of `earlyReturnRequested == fmi3True`. If the earlyReturnTime is greater than the last signaled intermediateUpdateTime, the FMU may integrate up to the time instant earlyReturnTime.

Informs the FMU to enter Initialization Mode.

Setting other variables is not allowed.
Also sets the simulation start and stop time.

# Arguments
- `c::FMU3Instance`: Argument `c` is a Mutable struct represents an instantiated instance of an FMU in the FMI 3.0 Standard.
- `toleranceDefined::fmi3Boolean`: Arguments `toleranceDefined` depend on the FMU type:
  - fmuType = fmi3ModelExchange: If `toleranceDefined = fmi3True`, then the model is called with a numerical integration scheme where the step size is controlled by using `tolerance` for error estimation. In such a case, all numerical algorithms used inside the model (for example, to solve non-linear algebraic equations) should also operate with an error estimation of an appropriate smaller relative tolerance.
  - fmuType = fmi3CoSimulation: If `toleranceDefined = fmi3True`, then the communication interval of the slave is controlled by error estimation.  In case the slave utilizes a numerical integrator with variable step size and error estimation, it is suggested to use “tolerance” for the error estimation of the internal integrator (usually as relative tolerance). An FMU for Co-Simulation might ignore this argument.
- `tolerance::fmi3Float64`: Argument `tolerance` is the desired tolerance
- `startTime::fmi3Float64`: Argument `startTime` can be used to check whether the model is valid within the given boundaries or to allocate memory which is necessary for storing results. It is the fixed initial value of the independent variable and if the independent variable is `time`, `startTime` is the starting time of initializaton.
- `stopTimeDefined::fmi3Boolean`:  If `stopTimeDefined = fmi3True`, then stopTime is the defined final value of the independent variable and if `stopTimeDefined = fmi3False`, then no final value
of the independent variable is defined and argument `stopTime` is meaningless.
- `stopTime::fmi3Float64`: Argument `stopTime` can be used to check whether the model is valid within the given boundaries or to allocate memory which is necessary for storing results. It is the fixed final value of the independent variable and if the independent variable is “time”, stopTime is the stop time of the simulation.

fmi3GetIntervalFraction retrieves the interval until the next clock tick.

For input Clocks it is allowed to call this function to query the next activation interval.
For changing aperiodic Clock, this function must be called in every Event Mode where this clock was activated.
For countdown aperiodic Clock, this function must be called in every Event Mode.
Clock intervals are computed in fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates (at the latest), therefore, this function should be called after fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates.

        nx::Csize_t)
Set a new (continuous) state vector and re-initialize caching of variables that depend on the states. Argument nx is the length of vector x and is provided for checking purposes

If `fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates` returned with `nominalsOfContinuousStatesChanged == fmi3True`, then at least one nominal value of the states has changed and can be inquired with `fmi3GetNominalsOfContinuousStates`.
Not allowed in Co-Simulation and Scheduled Execution.

# Arguments
- `c::FMU3Instance`: Mutable struct represents an instantiated instance of an FMU in the FMI 2.0.2 Standard.
- `x::AbstractArray{fmi3Float64}`: Argument `x` contains values of type `fmi3Float64` which is a alias type for `Real` data type. `x` is the `AbstractArray` which contains the `Real` values of the vector that represent the nominal values of the continuous states.
- `nx::Csize_t`: Argument `nx` defines the length of vector `x` and is provided for checking purposes

# Returns
- `status::fmi3Status`: Return `status` is an enumeration of type `fmi3Status` and indicates the success of the function call.
More detailed:
- `fmi3OK`: all well
- `fmi3Warning`: things are not quite right, but the computation can continue
- `fmi3Discard`: if the slave computed successfully only a subinterval of the communication step
- `fmi3Error`: the communication step could not be carried out at all
- `fmi3Fatal`: if an error occurred which corrupted the FMU irreparably
