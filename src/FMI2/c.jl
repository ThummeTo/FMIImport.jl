Function that is called in the FMU, usually if an fmi2XXX function, does not behave as desired. If “logger” is called with “status = fmi2OK”, then the message is a pure information message. “instanceName” is the instance name of the model that calls this function. “category” is the category of the message. The meaning of “category” is defined by the modeling environment that generated the FMU. Depending on this modeling environment, none, some or all allowed values of “category” for this FMU are defined in the modelDescription.xml file via element “<fmiModelDescription><LogCategories>”, see section 2.2.4. Only messages are provided by function logger that have a category according to a call to fmi2SetDebugLogging (see below). Argument “message” is provided in the same way and with the same format control as in function “printf” from the C standard library. [Typically, this function prints the message and stores it optionally in a log file.]

"""
    fmi2SetupExperiment(c::FMU2Component, toleranceDefined::fmi2Boolean, tolerance::fmi2Real, startTime::fmi2Real, stopTimeDefined::fmi2Boolean, stopTime::fmi2Real)

Informs the FMU to setup the experiment. This function must be called after `fmi2Instantiate` and before `fmi2EnterInitializationMode` is called.

# Arguments
- `c::FMU2Component`: Argument `c` is a Mutable struct represents an instantiated instance of an FMU in the FMI 2.0.2 Standard.
- `toleranceDefined::fmi2Boolean`: Arguments `toleranceDefined` depend on the FMU type:
  - fmuType = fmi2ModelExchange: If `toleranceDefined = fmi2True`, then the model is called with a numerical integration scheme where the step size is controlled by using `tolerance` for error estimation. In such a case, all numerical algorithms used inside the model (for example, to solve non-linear algebraic equations) should also operate with an error estimation of an appropriate smaller relative tolerance.
  - fmuType = fmi2CoSimulation: If `toleranceDefined = fmi2True`, then the communication interval of the slave is controlled by error estimation.  In case the slave utilizes a numerical integrator with variable step size and error estimation, it is suggested to use “tolerance” for the error estimation of the internal integrator (usually as relative tolerance). An FMU for Co-Simulation might ignore this argument.
- `startTime::fmi2Real`: Argument `startTime` can be used to check whether the model is valid within the given boundaries or to allocate memory which is necessary for storing results. It is the fixed initial value of the independent variable and if the independent variable is `time`, `startTime` is the starting time of initializaton.
- `stopTimeDefined::fmi2Boolean`:  If `stopTimeDefined = fmi2True`, then stopTime is the defined final value of the independent variable and if `stopTimeDefined = fmi2False`, then no final value
of the independent variable is defined and argument `stopTime` is meaningless.
- `stopTime::fmi2Real`: Argument `stopTime` can be used to check whether the model is valid within the given boundaries or to allocate memory which is necessary for storing results. It is the fixed final value of the independent variable and if the independent variable is “time”, stopTime is the stop time of the simulation.

# Returns
- `status::fmi2Status`: Return `status` is an enumeration of type `fmi2Status` and indicates the success of the function call.

Wrapper Function call to compute the partial derivative with respect to the variables `vKnown_ref`.

Computes the directional derivatives of an FMU. An FMU has different Modes and in every Mode an FMU might be described by different equations and different unknowns. The precise definitions are given in the mathematical descriptions of Model Exchange (section 3.1) and Co-Simulation (section 4.1). In every Mode, the general form of the FMU equations are:
𝐯_unknown = 𝐡(𝐯_known, 𝐯_rest)

- `v_unknown`: vector of unknown Real variables computed in the actual Mode:
   - Initialization Mode: unkowns kisted under `<ModelStructure><InitialUnknowns>` that have type Real.
   - Continuous-Time Mode (ModelExchange): The continuous-time outputs and state derivatives. (= the variables listed under `<ModelStructure><Outputs>` with type Real and variability = `continuous` and the variables listed as state derivatives under `<ModelStructure><Derivatives>)`.
   - Event Mode (ModelExchange): The same variables as in the Continuous-Time Mode and additionally variables under `<ModelStructure><Outputs>` with type Real and variability = `discrete`.
   - Step Mode (CoSimulation):  The variables listed under `<ModelStructure><Outputs>` with type Real and variability = `continuous` or `discrete`. If `<ModelStructure><Derivatives>` is present, also the variables listed here as state derivatives.
- `v_known`: Real input variables of function h that changes its value in the actual Mode.
- `v_rest`:Set of input variables of function h that either changes its value in the actual Mode but are non-Real variables, or do not change their values in this Mode, but change their values in other Modes

Computes a linear combination of the partial derivatives of h with respect to the selected input variables 𝐯_known:

   Δv_unknown = (δh / δv_known) Δv_known

# Arguments
- `c::FMU2Component`: Mutable struct represents an instantiated instance of an FMU in the FMI 2.0.2 Standard.
- `vUnknown_ref::AbstracArray{fmi2ValueReference}`: Argument `vUnknown_ref` contains values of type`fmi2ValueReference` which are identifiers of a variable value of the model. `vUnknown_ref` can be equated with `v_unknown`(variable described above).

- `vKnown_ref::AbstractArray{fmi2ValueReference}`: Argument `vKnown_ref` contains values of type `fmi2ValueReference` which are identifiers of a variable value of the model.`vKnown_ref` can be equated with `v_known`(variable described above).
- `nKnown::Csize_t`: Length of the `Known` Array.
- `dvKnown::AbstractArray{fmi2Real}`:The vector values Compute the partial derivative with respect to the given entries in vector `vKnown_ref` with the matching evaluate of `dvKnown`.
- `dvUnknown::AbstractArray{fmi2Real}`: Stores the directional derivative vector values.

# Returns
- `status::fmi2Status`: Return `status` is an enumeration of type `fmi2Status` and indicates the success of the function call.
More detailed:
 - `fmi2OK`: all well

- `s::fmi2StatusKind`: Argument `s` defines which status information is to be returned. `fmi2StatusKind` is an enumeration that defines which status is inquired.
The following status information can be retrieved from a slave:
  - `fmi2DoStepStatus::fmi2Status`: Can be called when the `fmi2DoStep` function returned `fmi2Pending`. The function delivers `fmi2Pending` if the computation is not finished. Otherwise the function returns the result of the asynchronously executed `fmi2DoStep` call.
  - `fmi2PendingStatus::fmi2String`: Can be called when the `fmi2DoStep` function returned `fmi2Pending`. The function delivers a string which informs about the status of the currently running asynchronous `fmi2DoStep` computation
  - `fmi2LastSuccessfulTime:: fmi2Real`: Returns the end time of the last successfully completed communication step. Can be called after fmi2DoStep(..) returned fmi2Discard.
  - `fmi2Terminated::fmi2Boolean`: Returns `fmi2True`, if the slave wants to terminate the simulation. Can be called after fmi2DoStep(..) returned `fmi2Discard`. Use fmi2LastSuccessfulTime to determine the time instant at which the slave terminated.
- `value::Ref{fmi2Integer}`: Argument `value` points to the return value (fmi2Integer) which was requested. `fmi2Integer` is a alias type for `Integer` data type.
# Returns
- `status::fmi2Status`: Return `status` is an enumeration of type `fmi2Status` and indicates the success of the function call.
More detailed:
  - `fmi2OK`: all well
  - `fmi2Warning`: things are not quite right, but the computation can continue
  - `fmi2Discard`: if the slave computed successfully only a subinterval of the communication step
  - `fmi2Error`: the communication step could not be carried out at all
  - `fmi2Fatal`: if an error occurred which corrupted the FMU irreparably
  - `fmi2Pending`: this status is returned if the slave executes the function asynchronously
